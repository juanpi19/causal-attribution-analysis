# Olist E-commerce Causal Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the causal effect of delayed delivery on customer satisfaction ratings in e-commerce, using data provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces.



## Research Question
Our two research questions are:

1. **What is the causal effect of delayed delivery on customer ratings?**

2. **What is the causal effect of delayed delivery on revenue?**

## Methodology

1. **Model Formulation**: Develop a causal inference model based on how we think the world works. We model it using a DAG.

2. **Causal Estimand Identification**: Determine an expression for the causal effect under our model assumptions.

3. **Statistical Estimation**: Apply advanced statistical methods such as matching or instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect.

4. **Robustness Checks**: Verify the validity of our estimates through various robustness checks.

## Causal Estimand Identification

### Estimand Specification
- **Method**: Backdoor Adjustment
- **Treatment Variable**: `is_delivery_late`
- **Outcome Variable**: `Rating`

### Mathematical Expression
The causal effect is identified through the following estimand:

```latex
P(Rating|is_delivery_late,distance_km,season,Product_category_encoded,freight_value,Product_size)
```

realizez estimand
```
Rating~is_delivery_late+distance_km+season+Product_category_encoded+freight_value+Product_size
```


## Expected Outcomes

This project aims to provide valuable insights into:
- The quantitative impact of delivery delays on customer satisfaction
- Key factors contributing to delivery delays in e-commerce
- Potential strategies for improving customer satisfaction in online retail

By leveraging causal inference techniques, we hope to move beyond mere correlation and uncover actionable insights for e-commerce businesses.

## Tools and Technologies

Python, DoWhy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/causal-attribution-analysis.git
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with the actual username or organization name where the repository is hosted.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd causal-attribution-analysis
   ```

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     py -3.9 -m venv venv
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt).

2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all necessary dependencies for the project.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```
deactivate
```
